demographic and socioeconomic status of respondents, aspirations,
social isolation, normlessness, labeling, attitudes toward deviance,
exposure to delinquent peers, commitment to delinquent peers, sex
roles, interpersonal violence, exposure to substance abuse,
self-reported delinquency, drug and alcohol use, and victimization.</span></p>
