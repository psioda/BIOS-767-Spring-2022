<p>In addition, the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data stipulates the following conditions:</p> <p>Federal law and regulations require that research data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice or by its grantees and contractors may only be used for research or statistical purposes. The applicable laws and regulations may be found in the United States Code, 42 USC Section 3789g(a), the Code of Federal Regulations, 28 CFR 22, and 62 F.R. 35044 (June 27, 1997) (The Federal Confidentiality Order). Accordingly, any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment may violate federal law as well as the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users of data collected by or with the support from the U.S. Department of Justice and distributed by NACJD or other ICPSR archives must agree to abide by these regulations and understand that ICPSR may report any potential violation to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

If you do not agree, you can click on the "I Do Not Agree" button to exit this page.</p><p>These data are distributed under the following terms of use. By continuing past this point to the data retrieval process, you signify your agreement to comply with the requirements as stated below:</p><h2>Privacy of RESEARCH SUBJECTS</h2><p>Any intentional identification of a RESEARCH SUBJECT (whether an individual or an organization) or unauthorized disclosure of his or her confidential information violates the PROMISE OF CONFIDENTIALITY given to the providers of the information. Disclosure of confidential information may also be punishable under federal law. Therefore, users of data agree:</p><ul><li><p>To use these datasets solely for research or statistical purposes and not for re-identification of specific RESEARCH SUBJECTS.</p></li><li><p>To make no use of the identity of any RESEARCH SUBJECT discovered inadvertently and to report any such discovery to CBHSQ and SAMHDA ( <a href="mailto:samhda-support@icpsr.umich.edu">samhda-support@icpsr.umich.edu</a>)</p></li></ul><h2>Citing Data</h2><p>You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic citation in any of your publications that use SAMHSA data. Authors of publications that use SAMHSA data are required to send citations of their published works to ICPSR for inclusion in a database of related publications (<a href="mailto:bibliography@icpsr.umich.edu">bibliography@icpsr.umich.edu</a>).</p><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>You acknowledge that SAMHSA and ICPSR will bear no responsibility for your use of the data or for your interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.</p><h2>Violations</h2><p>If SAMHSA or ICPSR determines that this terms of use agreement has been violated, then possible sanctions could include:</p><ul><li><p>Report of the violation to the Research Integrity Officer, Institutional Review Board, or Human Subjects Review Committee of the user's institution. A range of sanctions are available to institutions including revocation of tenure and termination.</p></li><li><p>If the confidentiality of human subjects has been violated, then report of the violation may be made to the Federal Office for Human Research Protections. This may result in an investigation of the user's institution, which can result in institution-wide sanctions including the suspension of all research grants.</p></li> <li><p>Report of the violation of federal law to the United States Attorney General for possible prosecution.</p></li><li><p>Court awarded payments of damages to any individual(s)/organization(s) harmed by the breach of confidential data.</p></li></ul> <h2>Definitions</h2><dl><dt>CBHSQ</dt><dd>Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality</dd><dt>ICPSR</dt><dd>Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</dd><dt>Promise of confidentiality</dt><dd>A promise to a respondent or research participant that the information the respondent provides will not be disseminated in identifiable form without the permission of the respondent; that the fact that the respondent participated in the study will not be disclosed; and that disseminated information will include no linkages to the identity of the respondent. Such a promise encompasses traditional notions of both confidentiality and anonymity. In most cases, federal law protects the confidentiality of the respondent's identity as referenced in the Promise of Confidentiality. Under this condition, names and other identifying information regarding respondents would be confidential.</dd><dt>Research subject</dt><dd>A person or organization that participates in a research study. A research subject may also be called a respondent. A respondent is generally a survey respondent or informant, experimental or observational subject, focus group participant, or any other person providing information to a study.</dd> <dt>SAMHDA</dt><dd>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive</dd><dt>SAMHSA</dt><dd>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</dd></dl>
